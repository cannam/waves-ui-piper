# Waves UI / Piper

A library to display and edit audio data and timeseries data in the browser.

This derivation of [waves - ui](https://github.com/wavesjs/waves-ui)
contains a number of modifications making it more appropriate for uses
involving longer audio files and larger datasets. However, it consists
of more complex code than the original library, it may be less well
suited than the original to smaller illustrative projects, and it
might not be a direct replacement in projects that are already using
the original. The editing functionality in particular has not been
well-tested for regressions or incompatibilities with the original.
